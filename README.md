# Basic-Line-Follower-Robot
Basic Line Follower Robot with Obstacle Avoidance: This Arduino-based robot uses IR sensors to follow a line and an ultrasonic sensor to avoid obstacles. The robot stops or moves backward if an obstacle is detected. LCD displays the distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor for real-time monitoring.
